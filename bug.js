This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This often happens when fetching data from an API and the data hasn't loaded yet or if the API returns null.  React Native will throw an error because it can't access the property of a null or undefined object.  For example, consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Potential error here */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

If the API request hasn't completed yet, `data` will be `null` and trying to access `data.name` will cause a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`.
